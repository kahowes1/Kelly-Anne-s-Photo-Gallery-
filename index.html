							<h2>I spy</h2>
							<p>I took this photo of a fall reef at a craft shop in downtown Blacksburg. I liked how the image looked like a page from an I spy book with the random smiley face on a pumpkin and the scattered pinecones.

							<h2>Into the woods</h2>
							<p> Blacksburg has a lot of fun things to do outside in the fall such as hiking. I took this photo of Sierra on a trail behind my apartment to capture the outdoorsy lifestyle of those in the town.

							<h2>As far as the eye can see</h2>
